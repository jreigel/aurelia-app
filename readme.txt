Pre Requisites-

    According to aurelia.io, you must first:

    Install NodeJS version 4.x or above.
    You can download it at https://nodejs.org/en/ .
    Install a Git Client
    Here's a nice GUI client https://desktop.github.com/
    Here's a standard client https://git-scm.com/


Running-

    Assuming you have git, node, and npm, you then:

    1. navigate to this directory (cd aurelia-app)
    2. npm install aurelia-cli -g
    3. npm install
    4. au run --watch   (watch option updates the server and refreshes the pages to reflect local changes)


    (Note: If you already have aurelia client in your global environment, you can skip step 2.) 

Distributing-
    Make sure to delete the node modules before uploading this project. The node modules can get quite bulky. 
    It is best to delete all modules, then let the next user use 'npm install'.
